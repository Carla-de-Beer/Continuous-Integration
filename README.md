# JavaScript Matrix Library
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Carla-de-Beer/javascript-matrix-library.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Carla-de-Beer/javascript-matrix-library)

Continuous integration example for a simple JavaScript matrix library project with npm where the continuous integation engine config file is nested within a subfolder rather than within the main repository. This would allow a number of smaller library components to be combined within a larger overarching project for which the build only passes when all the sub-modules pass the continuous integration tests.

Continuous integration is achieved through [CircleCi 2.0](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/).

The matrix library project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Carla-de-Beer/javascript-matrix-library/tree/development/matrix-library).
